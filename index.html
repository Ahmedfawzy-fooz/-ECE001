    Linux operating system 
    Linux (pronounced Linux) is a family of open source operating systems, which means that they can be modified and distributed by anyone around the world. This differs from proprietary software such as Windows, which can only be modified by the company that owns it. The advantages of Linux are that it is free, and there are many different versions that you can choose from.
    According to StatCounter statistics, the number of Linux users is less than 2% of the global operating system users. However, most servers run under Linux because it is relatively easy to adjust its features as desired.

    releases inS X is a line of operating systems created by Apple. It comes preloaded on all new clude El Captain (released in 2015), Yosemite (2014), Mavericks (2013), Mountain Lion (2012), and Lyon (2011).
According to statcounter global statistics, the number of Mac OS users is less than 10% of the global operating system users. This number is much lower than the percentage of Windows users (more than 80 percent). One reason for this is that Apple devices tend to be more expensive. However, many people prefer the look and feel of OS X over Windows.

    . Mobile devices such as phones, tablets, and MP3 players differ from desktop and laptop computers, as they run operating systems that are specifically designed for mobile devices. Examples of mobile operating systems include Apple iOS and Google Android. In the image below, you can see the iOS circuit running on the iPad.

    Operating systems for mobile phones are generally not quite as good as those made for desktop and

    The operating system is the most important program that runs on a computer. It manages everything related to computer memory and the processes that take place in it, as well as both software and hardware components (software and hardware). It also allows you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer language. Without an operating system, a computer is useless.
    operating system function
    Your computer's operating system (OS) manages both the software and hardware on the computer. Most of the time, there are many different computer programs running at the same time, and they all need access to your computer's central processing unit (CPU), memory, and hard disk drives. The operating system coordinates all of this to make sure that each program gets what it needs from the hardware resources.
    Types of operating systems
    Operating systems usually come per-installed on any computer you buy. Most people use the operating system that comes with their computer, but it is possible to upgrade or even change operating systems. The three most common operating systems for personal computers are Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.
    Modern operating systems use a graphical user interface, or GUI. The GUI allows you to use your mouse to click icons, press buttons, and select menus. Everything is displayed on the screen using a mixture of graphics and text.
    
    Each operating system's GUI has a different look, so if you change to a different operating system this may seem unfamiliar to you at first. However, modern operating systems are designed to be easy to use, and most of the basic principles of use are the same for everyo
